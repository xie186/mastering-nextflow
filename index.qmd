* Make Bioinformatics Analyses more reproducible
* Automate complex workflows 
* Scale analyses across multiple compute nodes
* Make it easier to run the same ccode across different computing platforms

Why is it imprortant to modularize your workflow code?

YOu can reuse the same modules in multiple workflows without rewriting code.
It makes code maintanace easier 

It can make code more readable by breaking it into smaller, manageable pieces.



Can you control the name of the task directories created at runtime under work/?



Is there a logic for why some arguments use a single dash (-resume) and some use a double dash (--input)? 

Single-dash options (-X) are built-in Nextflow runtime flags

Double-dash options (--param value) are pipeline parameters

Does it matter in what order you write inputs in a process call?

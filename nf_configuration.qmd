# Configuration



## Built-in configuration options in Nextflow
 
 
 `launchDir: Path`: 

     The directory where Nextflow is launched. Typically this is the project root directory.
 

`projectDir: Path`: 

    The root directory of the Nextflow project. By default, this is the same as `launchDir`, but it can be different if you are running a pipeline from a different location.


`secrets: Map<String,String>`: 

    A map of secret values that can be used in the workflow. This is useful for storing sensitive information such as API keys or passwords.

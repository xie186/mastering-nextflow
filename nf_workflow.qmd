# Workflows in Nextflow

In Nextflow, a **workflow** is a high-level construct that orchestrates the execution of multiple processes and sub-workflows. It defines the overall structure and flow of data through the various components of your pipeline. 



## Workflow output





```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false 
#| code-line-numbers: true
#| file: nf_example/test_output_block.nf
```


```{bash}
#| eval: false
nextflow run . \
  -main-script nf_example/test_output_block.nf \
  --meta test_data/sample_meta_sra.csv
```
